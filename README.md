# Hyperplexed Components

[Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed) makes incredible YouTube videos detailing the thought process behind replicating top-tier front-end visual effects from around the web. In order to potentially make these visual effects fit better into future projects (and as some personal practice in front-end design), this project aims to convert these visual effects into reusable and customizable React components that leverage TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick Start

To launch the project, clone this repo and run the following commands.

```sh
cd hyperplexed-components
npm install
npm start
```

## Using the Components

For now, this package is not published, so if you'd like to use the components, you may have to give it the ol' `Ctrl-C Ctrl-V`. Note that some components require the use of custom animations that need to be added to the `tailwind.config`. The instructions for doing so are provided in the `.tsx` files of the components that need it. For more on how to customize Tailwind's configuration, see [their documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).
